# Jems
I Worked in "Jems Beer" resturant as a Barman,
at the end of each day we would calculate the tips in a binder,
and i tried to change the process to be more easy
* Calculate tips for all the waiters in my restaurant.
* for to refresh click on the buttom "Home"
* To Search the shift  in the database click on the buttom "Search Shift"
